A typical Build Tracker application config consists of two possible keys: `artifacts` and `budgets`. Both are optional, but to get the most out of Build Tracker, configuring at least one is recommended.

## `artifacts`

Allows setting budgets for single or groups of artifacts, as well as filtering out and hiding artifacts from viewers.

### `artifacts.budgets`

An object map of artifact names to arrays of budgets for each artifacts.

```js
module.exports = {
  artifacts: {
    budgets: {
      main: [{ level: 'error', sizeKey: 'gzip', type: 'size', maximum: 150000 }]
    }
  }
};
```

### `artifacts.filters`

An array of regular expressions used to hide artifacts from display. This is typically not needed, unless you have artifacts generated by systems that really don't need to be checked.

For example, filter out all translation bundles except for the default:

```js
module.exports = {
  artifacts: {
    // Hide all packages matching 'i18n/.*', except for 'i18n/en'
    filters: [/^i18n\/(?!en$).*$/]
  }
};
```

### `artifacts.groups`

Have Build Tracker group specific artifacts together so you can track and budget on the sum of the artifacts. This is a great option when you have synchronous and asynchronous artifacts, allowing you to determine the byte-size required for initial page loads.

```js
module.exports = {
  artifacts: {
    groups: [
      {
        // An array of strings that match your artifacts
        artifactNames: ['main', 'shared', 'vendor'],
        // Optional, a regular expression to match artifact names
        artifactMatch: /^i18n/,
        // An array of budgets
        budgets: [{ level: 'error', sizeKey: 'gzip', type: 'size', maximum: 150000 }],
        // A name for the group
        name: 'Initial'
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## `budgets`
